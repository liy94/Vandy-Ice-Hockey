# Vandy-Ice-Hockey

This project is meant to help members of the Vanderbilt Ice Hockey club coordinate carpooling for getting to their practice facility. It will allow riders and drivers to let each other know when they need to be driven and where they need to be driven from. 

This is a web application with a frontend built with Typescript and React and a backend built with Express and Node. User information will be stored in a Mongo database.
